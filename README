This is QHTPicker. It's a PyQt version of HTPicker by mackstann
See his project, it's better: http://incise.org/htpicker.html

1. What's it do?

This is a basic tree-like file browser and launcher. The only thing
worth noting about it is that you can set the font/colors, and
customize your set of file handlers.


2. Handlers

They come in two parts, the glob and the launcher. When you select a
file and double-click it (or press enter), it will attempt to match
a handler by running through the list and matching one of the globs.

Here are some globs.
  *.nes
  *.txt
  *LOOKOUTBEHINDYOU.??.*

Launchers are the command lines that will be constructed and launched
with your selected filename.

Here's a launcher:
  fceu

With that glob and launcher, you'd see this file:
  Super Mario Bros 1 [U].nes
launched like this:
  fceu Super Mario Bros 1 [U].nes


3. Security and Implementation Notes

Don't put dumb launchers in. Python's subprocess.Popen is good, but not
that good. rm and dd are REALLY BAD launchers, so don't do it.

The config file is stored in your XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory, which is
typically ~/.config/. You shouldn't have to manually edit it, since
everything is covered in the preferences dialog.
